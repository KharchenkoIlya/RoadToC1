## Exam question #2
**Could you identify skills that you will need, to take care of the responsibilities of your future job? Why are they so important?**

In the future, I plan to become a top manager in Google, so here are the skills that I will need.
Let's start with hard skills. In Google I'll have to communicate with programmers, designers, data scientists etc.
To effectively communicate with them I need to know the basics of programming, design, data science and others.
Otherwise, I won't be able to even give them the tasks, because I won't know what they are capable of.

Now let's talk about soft skills. Google top managers have very strict schedules,
so time management is one of the most important skills for such a profession.

In Google, you also need to be very adaptive;
you need to be ready for a rapidly changing environment and to learn new technologies quickly
