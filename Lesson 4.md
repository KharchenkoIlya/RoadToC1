## Exam question #2
**Could you identify skills that you will need, to take care of the responsibilities of your future job? Why are they so important?**

In the future, I plan to become a top manager at Google, so here are the skills that I will need.
Let's start with hard skills. At Google I'll have to communicate with programmers, designers, data scientists, etc.
To effectively communicate with them I need to have a basic understanding of programming, design, data science and others.
Otherwise, I won't be able to assign tasks to them efficiently, because I won't know their capabilities.

Now let's discuss soft skills. Google top managers have very strict schedules,
so time management is one of the most important skills for such a profession.

At Google, you also need to be very adaptable;
you need to be prepared for a rapidly changing environment and to be able to quickly learn new technologies.
