## Use cases
## Exam question 1.
**What transferable skills are the most important in your current situation as a student? Are there any that aren’t important?**<br>
I use time management to figure out what tasks I should do in the first place.<br>
I use communication skills, for example, to ask my friend for his homework or ask to explain the topic that I don't understand. We should communicate more, because studying is a teamwork.<br>
I use critical thinking when I need to learn 100 words for an exam in one day (when I need to figure out how I will learn 100 words for exam in one day).<br>
I have skill adaptability, for example, I adapted perfectly to an English language program B1 being a complete beginner.<br>
Also, financial management is something very important for students, because students need to survive on a small scholarship.<br>
